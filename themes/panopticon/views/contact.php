        <h1>ABOUT MAKER CITIES</h1>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
<p>Maker Cities is a massively multiplayer game that empowers people to imagine and make the future of their city. </p>

<p>In the game, players submit ideas about how the maker movement might impact society at large: how we learn, govern, eat, and live. Players collaborate to refine each others’ ideas, and make and share simple prototypes to showcase their idea to the world.</p>

<p>Unlike some conventional approaches to thinking about the future that focus only on analytical approaches, Maker Cities allows people to build future ideas together inside a game. Sometimes the best way to imagine creative responses, shift our thinking, rekindle optimism and move towards action is by gaming and having fun and Maker Cities provides a platform for this to happen.</p>

<p>Every idea counts. We hope you will join us.</p>
